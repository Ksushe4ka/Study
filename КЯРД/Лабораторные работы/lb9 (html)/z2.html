        <div class="div4">THE GRID</div>
        <div class="div5">TYPOGRAPHY</div>
        <div class="div6">You should use Skeleton if you're embarking on a smaller project or just don't feel like you
            need all the utility of larger frameworks. Skeleton only styles a handful of standard HTML elements and
            includes a grid, but that's often more than enough to get started. In fact, this site is built on Skeleton
            and has ~200 lines of custom CSS (half of which is the docking navigation).</div>
        <div class="div7">The grid is a 12-column fluid grid with a max width of 960px, that shrinks with the
            browser/device at smaller sizes. The max width can be changed with one line of CSS and all columns will
            resize accordingly. The syntax is simple and it makes coding responsive much easier. Go ahead, resize the
            browser.</div>
        <div class="div8">Buttons come in two basic flavors in Skeleton. The standard element is plain, whereas the
            .button-primary button is vibrant and prominent. Button styles are applied to a number of appropriate form
            elements, but can also be arbitrarily attached to anchors with a .button class.</div>
